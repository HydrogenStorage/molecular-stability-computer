# Evaluate Performance

Evaluate the runtime for evaluating the Emin on your system.

Run the experiment by modifying `evaluate-speed.sh` to use a configuration appropriate for your system, if desired.
The current experiment runs one quantum chemistry computation per core, which is best for most users.

Then use the notebook to summarize runtimes.
