# Molecular Stability Computer

Estimate the synthesizability of a molecule by assessing its stability relative to other molecules.
Computes the E<sub>min</sub> metric proposed by Lee et al., which is the difference between the energy of a molecule 
and its lowest-energy constitutional isomer.

## Installation

> The installation requirements are only compatible with Linux.

Create a virtual environment with the required Python packages using Anaconda:

```commandline
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Then download [Surge](https://github.com/StructureGenerator/surge), which is used to generate candidate molecules.

```commandline
cd bin
. get-surge.sh
```

## Quickstart

The [`compute_emin.py`](./compute_emin.py) script is CLI application 
which computes E<sub>min</sub> for arbitrary molecules.

At minimum, it takes the SMILES string for your target molecule as input.

```commandline
time python compute_emin.py CC=C
```

The application will then compute the energy of the molecule using xTB,
then compare that energy to molecules from PubChem and those generated by Surge.

```

The results of energy calculations will be stored in the `runs` directory so that you can 
compute the energies of other molecules more quickly.

### Options

`compute_emin.py` provides a few options for 

- `--surge-amount`: How many molecules to generate with Surge. Set to either a fraction 
  of all possible molecules or a total amount.

A full listing of options for `compute_emin.py` is available by calling.
